Task Overview:
This project has been developed as part of a self-learning initiative to improve frontend development skills. 
The goal of this project is to build a simple yet interactive Quiz App using web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The primary focus is to implement a responsive and dynamic multiple-choice question interface that can assess a user's understanding on various topics.
In this project, the user interacts with a browser-based application that displays one question at a time. 
The user can select an option from the given choices, and after finishing all questions, the app shows the total score. 
The application emphasizes working with the DOM, handling user events, rendering data dynamically, and managing quiz flow logic.

Objectives of the Task:
The main objectives of this project are:
To build an interactive and user-friendly quiz system using frontend technologies.
To apply core JavaScript concepts like arrays, objects, functions, and events.
To improve understanding of DOM manipulation and user interaction.
To demonstrate the ability to render questions and handle user input dynamically.
To simulate real-world use cases like competitive exam platforms, learning tools, or trivia games.

Features of the Application:
Multiple Choice Questions:
The app displays one question at a time with multiple options to choose from.
Score Calculation:
Once the user completes the quiz, the total score is calculated and displayed.
Instant Feedback (Optional):
Can be extended to show right/wrong answer after each question.
Responsive Design:
The layout is mobile-friendly and works well on different screen sizes.
Dynamic Data Rendering:
Questions and options are rendered using JavaScript arrays/objects.
User-Friendly Interface:
Clean and modern UI using CSS with clear call-to-action buttons.

Technologies Used:
Technology	      Description
HTML5	            Structure of the web application
CSS3	            Styling and layout
JavaScript	      Logic and interactivity
Platform	        Visual Studio Code

How to Run the Program:
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that the following files are present:
index.html
style.css
script.js
Open index.html in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
The quiz will start and display questions one by one.
After completing the quiz, your score will be displayed.

Learning Outcome:
This project provided a practical and hands-on learning experience with web development. I gained confidence in:
Writing clean HTML structure and reusable CSS styles.
Working with JavaScript for real-time interactivity.
Dynamically rendering content and managing application state.
Handling user inputs and calculating results.
Building real-world mini-projects that simulate online test environments.
This project helped strengthen my understanding of client-side development and DOM manipulation â€” an essential part of frontend development. 
I now feel more confident building interactive web applications and plan to extend this project further by adding features like timers, user login, and a question database.

Task Status:
This self-learning task has been successfully completed. The application has been tested for correctness across different browsers and screen sizes. 
The complete project, including all source code and documentation, is available in the GitHub repository.
